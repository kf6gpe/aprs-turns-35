#  Getting on the air

*  Software for Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS or Android
*  A PC, cell phone, or tablet (portable is fun!)

*  (Optional) GPS receiver

# Software

Lots of choices, many of them old and clunky
*  PinPointAPRS (Windows)
*  APRSIS32 (Windows, very full featured)
*  javAPRS (Java, all platforms)
*  Xastir (Linux, can be built elsewhere)
*  APRSdroid (Android)
*  PocketPacket (iOS)
Or some Yaesu and Kenwood radios.


# Getting Connected

*  Bluetooth
*  USB (and USB-to-serial)
*  Sound modem
*  TCP/IP

# Bluetooth

*  Low-power, wireless protocol for audio and serial
*  Bluetooth Serial replaces RS-232 or USB serial
*  Works with some KISS TNCs (Moblinkd, Kenwood TH-D74A/E)
*  Great choice for portable with Android smartphones.
*  Not possible under iOS.

# USB

*  Serial connections for the new millennium
*  Some TNCs and radios have USB
*  Others will require a USB-RS232 adapter
*  Drivers for USB-RS232 can be fussy!
*  Works with Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android (maybe)

# Sound Modem

*  Uses the sound card in your computer or an external adapter.
*  Even works with some cell phone apps 
  * Just hold your phone next to your radio
  * Make a cable and use VOX
* PC, Mac and Linux need software (Direwolf, AGWPE, others)
* Can be tricky to set up (not all APRS apps work with all sound modem apps)

# TCP/IP
*  Used as backhaul to APRS network
*  A great choice for learning on your cell phone!

# Configuration
*  Call sign and SSID
*  Icon (funky codes abound!)
*  Digipeater path (stick with WIDE1-1)
*  IGate
*  Radio port stuff
