This project is stored on [Github](https://github.com/kf6gpe/aprs-turns-35). It will be a private repository until BayCon, and then released to the public. If you'd like access prior to Github, please contact Ray Rischpater for access.

## Presentation
To generate PDF, PowerPoint, and HTML presentations, make sure you have pandoc and pdflatex installed and run `make all`.

## Handouts
There's a (poorly formatted) handout with hints as to how to set up APRSdroid and PocketPacket in the directory `setup` directory; run `make handout.pdf` or `make handout.html` in that directory.
