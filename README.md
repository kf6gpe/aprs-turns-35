Presentation for [BayCon 2019](http://baycon.us/).

## Presentation
To generate PDF, PowerPoint, and HTML presentations, make sure you have pandoc and pdflatex installed and run `make all`.

## Handouts
There's a (poorly formatted) handout with hints as to how to set up APRSdroid and PocketPacket in the directory `setup` directory; run `make handout.pdf` or `make handout.html` in that directory.
